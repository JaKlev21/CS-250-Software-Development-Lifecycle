Jonathan Kleven's Readme for CS 250

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
Understanding the user's idea and developing it into an actionable user story is a skill that will require iterations and communication. However, I imagine a seasoned professional in Scrum-Agile will understand the right questions to ask at the moment they have with the users and stakeholders to help realize their vision. Additionally, I think it is encouraged for Scrum teams to communicate during every phase of the process to ensure the user stories contain the appropriate definition of "done."

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I recently had a hard drive failure, and the programs I used for my job were lost. So I am rebuilding the applications that I used. I am taking a more systematic approach. Before, I had one script that housed all my functions for various activities and the GUI. Now I am splitting them all into their respective tasks and having a separate GUI that calls the appropriate file and function. This will be aesthetically more pleasing. But it will do me no good if I do not back up my work! In this case, I am taking every action and dividing it into one file. Each action in this instance can be considered a User story. If I were to map it out, I would have a product backlog of all the lost functions. This could be an ongoing list of projects to be completed and integrated into a GUI.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member can communicate their place in the workload and can offer help where it's needed or inform the team that they need help.
